# M2_DistanceMeasurment
Nowadays, We have some difficulties in obtaining the distance that we want to measure. Even though, measuring tape can be used we may have limitation for measurement and may also have manual error. Manual distance measuring is always done at the expense of human error . Precise and fix measurment of low range distance is the main objective of the project. This device can measure distance in the range of 0.5m to 4m withe the accuracy of the 1 cm. This project is ude to measure the distance by using Ultrasonic Sensor. It works by transmitting ultrasonic waves at the 40KHz. Circuit that have been programmed with ATMega 328P . The distance will be displayed on LCD module . The importance of project calculating accurate distance from any obstacle that we want to measure . The device can be used in many different fields and categories like distance calculation in construction fiels , robots, car sensor to avoid obstacles and many other applications.
