INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, We have some difficulties in obtaining the distance that we want to measure. Even though, measuring tape can be used we may have limitation for measurement 
and may also have manual error. Manual distance measuring is always done at the expense of human error . Precise and fix measurment of low range distance is the main 
objective of the project.This project is ude to measure the distance by using Ultrasonic Sensor. It works by transmitting ultrasonic waves at the 40KHz. Circuit that
have been programmed with ATMega 328P . The distance will be displayed on LCD module . The importance of project calculating accurate distance from any obstacle that
we want to measure .

COMPONENTS

In this project we will be using hardware components such as : ATMega328P microcontroller, HD44780-14 LCD display, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor as an sensing device
a voltmeter.
the software components are: AVR compiler to run the code and generate hex file and other multi files.

ADVANTAGES

1.We can avoid manual error using this system.
2.It helps in achieving precise value.
3.It helps in calculating accurate distance from any obstacle that we want to measure .

OPPORTUNITIES

1. Automobiles(Automatic Car or vehicles)
2. Robotics

Threats 

1. Sensor disconnection.
2. Failure of the components.
